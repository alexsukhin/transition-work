# Abstract Thinking

**Palindromes**  

"RACECAR"  

Set string A to forward of "RACECAR"  
Set string B to backwards of "RACECAR"  
Check whether string A = string B
In this case, "RACECAR" is a palindrome.  

"DEFIED"  

Set string A to forward of "DEFIED"  
Set string B to bavckwards of "DEFIED"  
Check whether string A = string B  
In this case, "DEFIED" is not a palindrome.  

**Algorithm in English**  

Set index(n) to 0  
use a for loop repeating len(word)  
Push word[n] to string A  
Add 1 to n  

Set index(n) to len(word)-1  
Use a for loop repeating len(word)  
Push word[n] to string B  
Substract 1 from n  

If stirng A = string B word is a palindrome  

Examples for Abstraction  

Coffee machine
- provide water
- coffee beans
- select coffee you want

Driving a car  
- steering, braking, turning on the car

Typing
- clicking buttons, not knowing about binary
